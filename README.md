## The _CoinGecko_ API is used by this **CryptoX** to get real-time crypto data. It allows you to choose between the INR and the USD as your _currency_. It also displays the most popular cryptos, together with their profit and loss percentages. We acquire a list of hundreds of cryptos with some info using the _CoinGecko Coinlist_ API. We used _Chart.js_ to display a crypto price chart throughout time periods of 1 day, 30 days, 3 months, and a year. I also utilized _firebase authentication_ and _firestore_ to authenticate the user and let them to save their favorite cryptos on a watchlist.
